## Findings in a Nutshell
* Provided data was well appreciated but required significant time to wrap oneâ€™s head around it. 
* Participants had problems creating compelling stories and wanted more guidance on this. 
* Though we conducted a visualization sketching session at the beginning, participants new to visualizations still had some troubles using purposeful visualizations in their stories. 
* Designing compelling layouts that reflect the story-flow was not covered enough through the design patterns .


## Design
The design for this workshop was informed by two preceding workshops on data comics at the University of Edinburgh. Both workshops borrowed methodology from several related workshops.

Data comics are a way of effectively communicating with data through data visualizations. They are inspired by the visual language of comics. This website lists examples we found online and those created during our research. We hope this website and our examples support a wider discussion and inspire journalists, artists, data scientists, and others to create their own data comics and help exploring and discovering this novel medium.
